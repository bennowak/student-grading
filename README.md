# student-grading
**A python module to simplify student grading from GitHub submissions**

## Overview
The program takes a `csv` file containing assignment data, student names, and urls for assignment submissions on GitHub, then automates the process of creating directories and grading sheets for their submissions.

## Process Description
The script will search the `resources/AssignmentCSVFiles` directory for existing assignment files.  These will show up in the main running menu.  The first row of the selected `assignment.csv` file will be parsed for assignment data used to generate a specific directory structure under the `Gradings` directory. The subsequent rows contain student names, and submission URLs for processing and downloading assignments automatically.

## Folder Organization Concerns

This program is intended to reside inside a single directory where the grader (TA, Instructor, etc.) does all of their grading.  This will mean that each call to the program will either generate a new directory, or update the records for existing assignment directories with the `Grading` directory.  So what does this look like as originally intended by the author.

    - Grading/
        - Homework01_Some_Homework/
        - Homework02_Some_more_homework/
        - Homework03_Even_more_homework/
            - Grades/
                - Student01.md
                - Student02.md
                - Student03.md
            - Instructions/
            - Solutions/
            - Submissions/
                - Student01/
                    - Student01.zip
                - Student02/
                    - Student02.zip
                - Student03/
                    - Student03.zip
    - resources/
        - AssignmentCSVFiles
            - Homework01_Some_Homework.csv
            - Homework02_Some_more_homework.csv
            - Homework03_Even_more_homework.csv
        - GradingMDFiles
            - Homework01_Some_Homework.md
            - Homework02_Some_more_homework.md
            - Homework03_Even_more_homework.md
        student_list.txt
    - TEMPLATES/
    - tyjgrader/
    - run_tyjgrader.py (program script)

## Before running the script: 
- a **copy** of the `TEMPLATE_GradeSheet.md` file has been named and customized to reflect the rubric and grading concerns for that particular assignment, and has been placed in the `GradingMDFiles` directory.
- a **copy** of the `TEMPLATE_Assignment.csv`file has been properly prepared, named, and moved to the `AssignmentCSVFiles` directory

## "Parts" of the Process

- #### run_tyjgrader.py
    This is the main entry point for the application.  Run the script as follows:

    ```
    python run_tyjgrader.py
    ```
- #### ./tyjgrader/ (module)
    This is the directory that contains the python processing module code
   
- #### ./TEMPLATES/
    A directory of example files as the `assignment.csv`, and `grade_sheet.md` files should be laid out
    
- #### ./resources/
    Contains directories for the actual `assignment.csv` and `grade_sheete.md` files.
    
    - #### AssignmentCSVFiles/
        The directory for individual "assignment" `csv` data files.  These are the files that will be used to process particular assignments.  
        **NOTE: BE SURE TO FORMAT THESE CORRECTLY IF NOT AUTOGENERATING THEM**      
        See the `TEMPLATE_Assignment.csv` file in the `TEMPLATES` folder for clarification

    - #### GradingMDFiles/
        The directory for individual "grading sheet" `Markdown` files. These are the files that will be used to generate individual student grade sheets for particular assignments     
        **NOTE: BE SURE TO FORMAT THESE CORRECTLY IF NOT AUTOGENERATING THEM**      
        See the `TEMPLATE_GradeSheet.md` file in the `TEMPLATES` folder for clarification

- #### ./Gradings/
    This is where the directories that are created for grading assignments will be output.

    - #### <OUTPUT_DIR>
        The generated directory for a particular assignment
        
        - #### Grades
            The directory that holds the Markdown "grading sheets" for each student
        
        - #### Submissions
            Directory with individual directories for each student that contain the downloaded submissions
    
### Output

Given the following assignment `csv` file : 
```csv
HW00_TestGrade, Test 00, "Saturday, January 1st, 2001 at 11:59 pm", test_gradesheet.md, TA Tester
Bee Gud, https://github.com/bennowak/student-grading
Som Purrsen, null
Jam Out, https://github.com/bennowak/student-grading/archive/master.zip
```

Running the script at the command line will yield the following structure :

## Additional Notes
- If you are intending to store your grades and student submissions in a git repository or on a remote repository hosting service (such as GitHub, or others) then be sure to edit the `.gitignore` file to allow the tracking of the `.zip` files in the student submissions.
- Running the process on existing assignments (whith existing directories, and such) will only update "new" submissions from the assignment file.  Existing submissions will not be overwritten.
- If you need to update a submission consider either removing the original submission `grade_sheet` and `url` in the assignment csv file, or adding a second entry for the same student (using a variation on their name to indicate the different submission.)
- If you are unclear about some fo the specifics, I encourage you to run a few tests using the test `assignment` to see how the script works.


## If An Error Occurs

- Delete the folder for that assignment and try again and check the formatting of your `assignment.csv` and `grade_sheet.md` files for that particular assignment. Be sure to follow the template form exactly.
